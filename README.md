## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
-Service-oriented architecture, or SOA. It provides an interface-based method for reusing software components. 
Applications that utilize services offered by the network are referred to as SOAs in architectural terminology. Through an internet-based network call,
 services this are made available to apps in this design. It speeds up and simplifies service connections in applications by 
utilizing common communication standards. In SOA, every service is an independently full-featured business operation. 

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
-The characteristics of SOA are that this can separate the complexity this can make integration manageable. Also SOA can
 easily to fin or discoverability this can find the store metadata in a service registry or a profile fast.

3. Define Microservices.
-The term "microservices," or "microservice architecture," refers to a software development technique that divides 
programs into separate parts with unique features and clear interfaces.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
-The benefits of using microservices are that first, microservices are advantage for engineers because microservices 
are architectural model that are better facilitates in an operational model. Also microservices is in charge of a particular activity, 
microservices provide greater data security and compliance and make it simpler to deploy security measures at the service level. And lastly 
microservices design allows for the flexibility of employing the appropriate tools for each project's requirements because each microservices 
can be executed on any platform and developed in any language. This will benefit in terms of both speed and employee morale.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
-The similarities and difference of SOA and microservices are that they are both relying on services as their main component 
but they are different in terms of service characteristics.
